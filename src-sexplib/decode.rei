/** Turn S-expressions into Ocaml values via Sexplib. */

/** Following the convention of [Sexplib0.Sexp_conv.hashtbl_of_sexp], we
    consider an S-expression to be an "object" if it is a list of two-element
    lists. For example:

        ((field1 value1) (field2 (value2 value3)))

    Following `dune` conventions, we also allow as "objects" S-expressions like:

        ((field1 value1) (field2 value2 value3))

    These two S-expressions will be treated in the same way by the object
    combinators below (e.g. [field]).

    Like YAML, fields of an object are not necessarily atoms. To handle these,
    look for the primed combinators (e.g. [keys']).
